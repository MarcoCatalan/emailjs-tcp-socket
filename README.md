tcp-socket
==========

This shim brings [Mozilla-flavored](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/TCP_Socket) version of the [Raw Socket API](http://www.w3.org/TR/raw-sockets/) to node.js and Chromium. Its purpose is to enable apps to use the same codebase in Firefox OS, Chrome OS, and on the server.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/whiteout-io/tcp-socket.svg?branch=dev/umd)](https://travis-ci.org/whiteout-io/tcp-socket)

Feel free to you include in your [Chrome Packaged App](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/apps)!

# Usage

An example can be found in ```example/```:

    1) cd example && node server.js
    2) add the example-folder as a chrome app (chrome settings -> extensions -> check 'developer mode' -> load unpacked extension)
    3) launch the extension
    4) have fun with navigator.TCPSocket

Include ```tcp-socket.js``` and ```forge``` in your markup. It will attach itself to the navigator object.
    
    <script src="forge.min.js"></script>
    <script src="tcp-socket.js"></script>

    // creates a TCP socket
    var tcp = navigator.TCPSocket.open('127.0.0.1', 8000);

    // creates a TLS socket
    var tls = navigator.TCPSocket.open('127.0.0.1', 9000, {
        useSSL: true,
        ca: 'insert PEM-formatted cert here'
    });

**A note on TLS**: [Native TLS is not yet available for chrome.socket.](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=132896). For this reason, we cannot tap into the browser's native SSL certificates. If you want to use TLS, you must provide a certificate for pinning! This shim depends on [forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) for TLS. Please consult the [forge project page](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) for examples how to make forge available in your application and/or have a look at the eample in this repository.

For everything else, see the [Mozilla TCPSocket API Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TCPSocket).
